## Name of Student: Derrak Richard
## Name of Project: Data visualizer with D3

## Project's Purpose or Goal: Allow users to input data via a form or csv and select which graph type is produced with that data.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- Website with UI that lets users input or upload data and select which type of graph/data visualization they want to produce
- Backend converts inputted data into format useable by D3
- graph/data visualization user selected displayed with userâ€™s data
## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- JavaScript-D3.js is a javaScript library
- HTML, CSS
- React, for the frontend

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- Expand/ add graph types user can choose from
- Enhance UI
- Look into making code reusable (https://www.toptal.com/d3-js/towards-reusable-d3-js-charts)

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- CSS framework like Bootstrap or Materialize
 
 
##  Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
