##  Epicodus Capstone Project: Explore D3.js
------------------------------


## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description
My main goal was to explore the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) data visualization library. Deliverable wise, my goal was to make an interactive site using D3 React, and Firebase, where a user could input data and have it displayed in a series of graphs. 

Upon further exploration, I learned that D3 and React both want to control the DOM, and can conflict with each other. There are many ways to work around these conflicts, many of them explained by Marcos Iglesias in [Bringing Together React, D3, And Their Ecosystem.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/react-d3-ecosystem/) Adam Janes, who teaches the [Introduction to D3.js with React](https://www.udemy.com/course/d3-react/) course on Udemy opted to go with the Lifecycle Methods Wrapping method, which makes use of the lifecycle methods present in class-based React components. I followed that rabbit for a few hours, but due to time constraints, and figuring out that probably wasn't the most up-to-date method, I tabled it for now.

To have something to show at the end of the week, I took what I had lerned in the tutorials, and applied it to create a Sankey chart using D3 and just basic HTML. Sankey charts are something I've used in previous jobs to display Structural equation modeling (SEM) model pututs in more user-comprehensable fashion. 

Here's a pretty typical structural equation model output, depicting a fictional survey of Epicodus students on what inputs most impacts overall satisfaction with the program. The numbers associated with the arrows show how much each input impacts the items upstream, which finally impacts Overall Satisfaction.

Here's the same data, visualized with a Sankey Diagram. Though it could be improved, I think having each link relatively sized according to its associated value has a huge impact on the readability of the model. It's much easier to visually see where the larger impacts are, rather than trying to read, and remember each value, as you have to do in the first example.
